        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This traditional Tuscan strip steak recipe utilizes just a handful of pantry staples to create a dish that any steak-lover is sure to love. Serve this simple dish with a glass of Italian red wine (like Chianti) to be instantly transported to the rolling hills of Tuscany.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 2-pound porterhouse steak</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor charcoal grill over high heat.</li>
            <li>Dip the bunch of fresh rosemary into the olive oil and use the herbs to brush oil over the entire surface of the steak.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the steak liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer the steak to the grill and cook until a deep brown crust has formed, about 5–7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the steak and cook the other side until browned, about 5–7 minutes. If you have a food thermometer, test the internal temperature of the meat. A medium-rare steak will have an internal temperature of 130–135 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Remove the meat from the grill and allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
            <li>Slice the steak into strips and sprinkle with additional salt, pepper, and sprigs of fresh rosemary before serving.</li>
        </ol>
